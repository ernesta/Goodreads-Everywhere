# Goodreads Everywhere

A must-have extension for all bookworms, Goodreads Everywhere adds Goodreads ratings to Amazon, Audible, Google Play, and more.
Goodreads Everywhere adds Goodreads ratings to Amazon, Audible, the Book Depository, Google Play, and the Strand to make your book shopping experience just a bit more enjoyable.

Well, at least that's what it used to be. But times change, and so does website DOM, so by now this doesn't actually work. While it's not difficult to fix, keeping the extension up-to-date is way too much effort.

## Thanks
Thanks to Made Somewhere from the Noun Project for the book icon.
